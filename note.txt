what is Big O
Big O notation is used to describe the time complexity of data structures and algorithms:

Important concepts
1.growth is with respect to the input
2.Constants are dropped
3.Worst case is usually the way we measure

*array
-a data structure that stores related data in a collection of elements, or boxes, 
where each element has a position and can hold a value
-it is a contigous location

*linear search O(N)
-geedy algorithm

*binary search 
-An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, 
until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
-the array becomes n/2 n/4 n/8 ..... n/2^k this meand log 2^n=k
O(logN) 
O(NlogN)-if we look the halfed array linearly
-two crystal ball problem   
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25
                  ^        *     ^
jump by 5,first ball breaks at 15's story then go back to 10 then linearly look for a break point

*bubble sort
-repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted,
compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
-gausian sum the number from 1..100 in a short time while he was a kid using n(n+1)/2
O(N^2)
5,7,4,1 -> 5,4,1,7

*selection
-It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion
and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion.
O(N^2)
5,7,4,1 -> 1,4,1,5

*insertion
-Imagine holding a hand of playing cards and you want to sort them in ascending order.
You take one card at a time and insert it into its correct position among the previously sorted cards.
O(N^2)
5,6,4,1 -> [in between 5,6,6,1 -> 5,5,6,1] -> 4,5,6,1

*Linked list
-what sucked aobut array its un growable,there in no deletion and insertion
-it is a node based DS

*Queue
-a line a FIFO structure
-specfic implemntation of a linked list,constrainig what we can do with linked list

*Arrya list,Array buffer

*Recursion 
-a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem
-solves problems by using functions that call themselves within their own code

*maze solver

*quick sort
-it is a divide and conqure algorithm
-O(n logn) or [ O(n^2) if its a reversed array ]
8,7,6,4,5 -> [4,7,6,8,5 in between] -> 4,5,6,8,7

*Doubly linked list
